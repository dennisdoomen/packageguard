## About

### What's this?

PackageGuard is a fully open-source tool to scan the NuGet dependencies of your .NET solutions against a deny- or allowlist to control the open-source licenses that you want to allow or certain versions of certain packages you want to enforce or avoid. 

### What's so special about that?

I've noticed that the commercial solutions for this are usually very expensive and have functionality that smaller companies may not need. Hopefully this little tools fills the gap between tools like GitHub's Dependabot and expensive commercial products like Blackduck, SNYK  and others.

### Who created this?
My name is Dennis Doomen and I'm a Microsoft MVP and Principal Consultant at [Aviva Solutions](https://avivasolutions.nl/) with 28 years of experience under my belt. As a software architect and/or lead developer, I specialize in designing full-stack enterprise solutions based on .NET as well as providing coaching on all aspects of designing, building, deploying and maintaining software systems. I'm the author of several open-source projects such as [Fluent Assertions](https://www.fluentassertions.com), [Reflectify](https://github.com/dennisdoomen/reflectify), [Liquid Projections](https://www.liquidprojections.net), and I've been maintaining [coding guidelines for C#](https://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com) since 2001.

## Download

The tool is available as [a NuGet Tool package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/packageguard) and can be installed like this:

  `dotnet tool install PackageGuard --global`

Then use `packageguard --help` to see a list of options.

```
USAGE:
    PackageGuard.dll [path] [OPTIONS]

        --use-caching            Maintains a cache of the package information to speed up future analysis
        --cache-file-path        Overrides the file path where analysis data is cached. Defaults to the "<workingdirectory>/.packageguard/cache.bin"
```

## How do I configure it?

First, you need to create a JSON configuration file listing the packages and/or licenses you want to allow/deny list. By default, this file is called `config.json` and loaded from the working directory, but you can override that using the `--configpath` CLI parameter. The config file needs to have the following format:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "allow": {
          "licenses": [
              "Apache-2.0", // Uses SPDX naming
              "MIT",
          ],
          "packages": [
              "MyPackage/[7.0.0,8.0.0)"
          ]            
        },
        "deny": {
          "licenses": [],
          "packages": [
            "ProhibitedPackage",
            "MyPackage/(,1.0.0)",      // Deny all versions below 1.0.0 (including pre-release versions)
            "AnotherPackage/2.0.0-alpha.1" // Deny specific pre-release version
          ]
        },
        "ignoredFeeds": [
          "https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/somecompany/project/_packaging/myfeed/nuget/v3/index.json"
        ]
    }
}
```

In this example, only NuGet packages with the MIT or Apache 2.0 licenses are allowed, the use of the package `ProhibitedPackage` is prohibited, `MyPackage` should stick to version 7 only, and all versions of `MyPackage` below 1.0.0 (including pre-release versions) are denied along with a specific pre-release version of `AnotherPackage`. Both the `allow` and `deny` sections support the `licenses` and `packages` properties. But licenses and packages listed under `allow` have precedence over those under the `deny` section.

License names are case-insensitive and follow the [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) naming conventions, but we have special support for certain proprietary Microsoft licenses such as used by the `Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi*` packages. For those, we support using the license name `Microsoft .NET Library License`.

Package names can include just the NuGet ID but may also include a [NuGet-compatible version (range)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/concepts/package-versioning?tabs=semver20sort) separated by `/`. Here's a summary of the possible notations:


| Notation        | Valid versions     |
|-----------------|--------------------|
| "Package/1.0"   | 1.0            |
| "Package/[1.0,)"| v ≥ 1.0            |
| "Package/(1.0,)"          | v > 1.0            |
| "Package/[1.0]"           | v == 1.0           |
| "Package/(,1.0]"          | v ≤ 1.0            |
| "Package/(,1.0)"          | v < 1.0            |
| "Package/[1.0,2.0]"       | 1.0 ≤ v ≤ 2.0      |
| "Package/(1.0,2.0)"       | 1.0 < v < 2.0      |
| "Package/[1.0,2.0)"       | 1.0 ≤ v < 2.0      |

### Denying Pre-release Versions

A common use case is to prevent the use of pre-release packages in production code. Pre-release versions are those that contain labels like `-alpha`, `-beta`, `-rc`, etc., or versions below 1.0.0. Here are some common patterns:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "deny": {
            "packages": [
                "MyPackage/(,1.0.0)",        // Deny all versions below 1.0.0 (catches 0.x.x and pre-release versions)
                "AnotherPackage/*-alpha*",    // Note: This exact syntax is not supported, use specific ranges instead
                "SpecificPackage/2.0.0-alpha.1" // Deny a specific pre-release version
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

**Common pre-release denial patterns:**
- `"Package/(,1.0.0)"` - Denies all versions below 1.0.0, including pre-release versions like 0.9.0-alpha.1
- `"Package/1.0.0-alpha.1"` - Denies a specific pre-release version
- `"Package/[1.0.0-alpha,1.0.0)"` - Denies pre-release versions of 1.0.0 (like 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-beta.2)

You can also tell PackageGuard to allow all packages from a particular feed, even if a package on that feed doesn't meet the licenses or packages listed under `allow`. Just add the element `feeds` under the `allow` element and specify a wildcard pattern that matches the name or URL of the feed.

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "allow": {
            "feeds": ["*dev.azure.com*"]
        }
    }
}
```

And in case you want to prevent PackageGuard from trying to access a particular feed altogether, add them to the `ignoredFeeds` element. Notice that PackageGuard may still trigger a `dotnet restore` call if the package lock file (`project.assets.json`) doesn't exist yet, unless you use the `SkipRestore` option, that will use all available NuGet feeds.

## How do I use it?

With this configuration in place, simply invoke PackageGuard like this

`packageguard --configpath <path-to-config-file> <path-to-solution-file-or-project>`

If you pass a directory, PackageGuard will try to find the `.sln` files there. But you can also specify a specific `.csproj` to scan. 

If everything was configured correctly, you'll get something like:

![](Docs/Screenshot.png)

The exit code indicates either 0 for success or 1 for failure. 

## Additional notes

### Speeding up the analysis using caching

One of the most expensive operations that PackageGuard needs to do is to download find the license information from GitHub or other sources. You can significantly speed-up the analysis process by using the `--use-caching` flag. 

By default, this will cause PackageGuard to persist the license information it retrieved to a binary file under `.packageguard\cache.bin`. You can commit this file to source control so successive runs can reuse the license information it collected during a previous run. 

If PackageGuard finds new packages in your project or solution that did not exist during the previous run, then it will update the cache after the analysis is completed.  

### Github rate limiting issues

If you're running into errors from GitHub like 

  `Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (rate limit exceeded).`

it means PackageGuard has ran into the [rate limits](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28) of `api.github.com` while trying to fetch license information from certain repositories. You can solve that by either waiting an hour or creating a GitHub Personal Access Token with the `public_repo` scope. You can find more information about those tokens [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps).

After having generated such a token, pass it to PackageGuard through its `github-api-key` option or set-up an environment variable named `GITHUB_API_KEY`.

## Roadmap

This is a rough list of items from my personal backlog that I'll be working on the coming weeks.

**Major features**
- Add support for the new .slnx file
- Add NPM support

**Minor features**
- Allow specifying the location of `dotnet.exe`
- Allow ignoring certain .csproj files or folders using Globs or wildcards (e.g. build.csproj)
- Allow marking all violations as a warning
- Allow marking individual violations as a warning
- Expose the internal engine through the `PackageGuard.Core` NuGet package
- Add direct support for [Nuke](https://nuke.build/)
- Allow loading settings from the directory of the scanned project and move up if not found
- Display the reason why a package was marked as a violation
